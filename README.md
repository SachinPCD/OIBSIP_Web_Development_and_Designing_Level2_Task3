# Oasis Infobyte Internship Task  

### Basic ToDo WebApp Implementation

***

## Project Overview

This repository showcases a **comprehensive ToDo WebApp** built for the Oasis Infobyte "Web Development and Designing" internship task. The application streamlines daily task management, empowering users to add, edit, mark as complete, filter, and delete tasks. The interface supports both Pending and Completed tasks, with additional features such as due dates, priorities, bulk actions, search functionality, statistics, theme toggling, and undo capabilities.

***

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**  
  Structured all major app components including header, input section, statistics, filters, task lists, modals, and notifications for semantic clarity and accessibility.
- **CSS3**  
  Developed custom styles for theme management, responsive layouts, card-based lists, animations for user feedback, interactive controls, and accessibility enhancements.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
  Implemented robust class-based task management logic covering state handling, rendering, event-driven updates, local storage integration, user feedback notifications, live editing, drag-and-drop reordering, and milestone tracking.

## Key Features

- **Task Creation and Management**
  - Add tasks with priority and due date.
  - Mark tasks as complete or active; completed tasks appear in a separate list.
  - Edit task description instantly with double-click, keyboard shortcuts, or inline controls.
  - Delete any task, with confirmation.
- **Bulk Actions**
  - Mark all tasks complete or active.
  - Clear all completed tasks at once.
  - Undo last actions for error recovery.
  - Export all tasks to a JSON file for backup or migration.
- **Filtering and Search**
  - Switch between viewing All, Active, or Completed tasks efficiently.
  - Search tasks instantly using the input bar.
- **Statistics and Progress**
  - Real-time stats on total, active, and completed tasks.
  - Visual progress bar displays percentage completed.
- **User Interface and Experience**
  - Responsive layout for all devices.
  - Theme toggle for dark/light mode, respecting system preference and saving user choice.
  - Keyboard shortcuts for efficient interaction.
  - Contextual toast notifications for user actions and milestones.
- **Persistent Storage**
  - All tasks saved and loaded from browser local storage to ensure persistence across sessions.

## Implementation Approach

1. **Organized HTML Structure**  
   All UI components—input forms, lists, controls, notifications, and modals—are cleanly segmented for maintainability and clarity.

2. **Efficient JavaScript Logic**  
   Encapsulated task state, event handling, and rendering in a class for separation of concerns. Used feature-rich ES6 syntax for concise, readable code. Implemented optimized rendering and interactive experiences based on user actions and task state changes.

3. **Custom CSS Design**  
   Prioritized accessible color contrast, interactive feedback, responsive breakpoints, and visually distinct controls for a modern, professional appearance.
